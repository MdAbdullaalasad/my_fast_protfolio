        <h3>My lifestyle..</h3>
        <p class="jastify">My daily lifestyle has a huge impact on my health. Recently, without any notion of this writing assignment, I have taken action to monitor what I eat. The reason for this insight is because my family and friends always mention that I am skinny and I need to eat more. I realize from previous chapters about health and fitness, nutrition, and weight management, just to name a few, have brought to my attention that it is important to record what you put in your body.</p>

        <b>Become a web developer....</b>
        <p class="jastify">I'll be dreaming of you tonight, 'til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight, and there's no where in the world I'd rather be, then here in my room dreaming of you endlessly. I dream of you when I'm asleep, you even appear when I'm awake daydreaming. There is no escaping you. I just wish it was true.
        I went to sleep last night with a smile because I knew I'd be dreaming of you ... but I woke up this morning with a smile because you weren't a dream.</b><br><br>
